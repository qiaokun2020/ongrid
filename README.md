## Overview

ongrid is an open-source, self-hostable AIOps platform. A lightweight `ongrid-edge` agent on each host ships metrics, logs, and traces to the cloud over a single **outbound** tunnel — no inbound ports on the host. The cloud is an LLM-driven ops agent: ask in natural language and it runs the PromQL / LogQL / TraceQL, walks the service topology, searches the knowledge base, reads source code, and calls read-only host tools to return a grounded, evidence-backed answer.

What it solves:

- **High troubleshooting bar** — describe the symptom ("why is load spiking?", "who's dropping packets?"); the agent figures out which metric, which logs, and which query to look at.
- **Alerts disconnected from root cause** — on an alert it walks the topology for blast radius, correlates logs/traces, and pins down the **source-code location** behind the "why".
- **Scattered signals** — metrics (Prometheus), logs (Loki), traces (Tempo), a knowledge base (vector search), and source repos are unified and analyzed in one session.
- **No exposed intranet** — edge dials out; zero inbound ports on hosts; the telemetry data plane is separated from the control plane.
- **Self-hostable** — one `docker compose` brings up the full stack; point the model at any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. configure: set the admin account + a model API key
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env

# 2. bring up the full stack (mysql / ongrid / frontier / nginx / prometheus / grafana)
make compose-up      # make compose-down to stop
```

Open `https://<host>` and sign in with the admin account seeded from `.env`. For a production release package (TLS, systemd, upgrade/uninstall) see [`deploy/install/`](deploy/install/README.md).

**Install edge on a host** — create the edge in the console, copy the one-line install command for the target platform, and run it. The edge dials out and listens on no inbound port.

> Building from source: `make build` (the cloud is `CGO_ENABLED=1` for the local ONNX embedder) and `cd web && npm ci && npm run build`. Run `make help` for all targets.

- **edge (`ongrid-edge`)** — one per host, pure-Go single binary; collects telemetry and exposes read-only inspection tools over the tunnel. Dials out, zero inbound ports.
- **cloud (`ongrid`)** — manager + LLM coordinator that dispatches to specialist sub-agents and tools (PromQL / LogQL / TraceQL / topology / knowledge search / source reading) and synthesizes the answer.
- **web** — React SPA: conversational troubleshooting + dashboards.
